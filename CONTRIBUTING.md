# Contributing to RiverObs
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features


## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept [pull requests](../../pulls).  We use the github workflow, here are some examples:
* https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/ quick overview
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UguQzmswC4 more in-depth video showing how to do it


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](../../issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!
See these for examples:
* https://guides.github.com/features/issues/
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSIHnwPT5_k

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Use [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with the exception of CamelCase for module filenames and directories.
