# RiverObs

This is a package written initially by
[Ernesto Rodriguez](mailto:ernesto.rodriguez@jpl.nasa.gov) to estimate
various river parameters starting from remote sensing data.
[Alex Fore](mailto:alexander.fore@jpl.nasa.gov) and [Brent Williams](mailto:brent.a.williams@jpl.nasa.gov) have also provided
code to reflect the evolving SWOT project.
The code is currently maintained by the SWOT Algorithm Definition Team.

Detailed installation instructions are in the Install.md file.

# Usage

For generating data products are most similar to the SWOT project's data products, the following script is recommended (found in src/bin):
```
usage: swot_pixc2rivertile.py [-h] [--shpbasedir SHPBASEDIR] [-l LOG_LEVEL]
                              [--gdem-file GDEM_FILE]
                              pixc_file out_riverobs_file out_pixc_vector_file
                              rdf_file
```
where ```pixc_file``` is the SWOT high-resolution pixel cloud data product, ```out_riverobs_file``` is the filename of the output rivertile data product, ```out_pixc_vector_file``` is the filename of the output pixel cloud vector data product, ```rdf_file``` is the configuration file (see [this link](https://github.com/SWOTAlgorithms/RiverObs/blob/develop/src/bin/swot_pixc2rivertile.py#L13)) for the recomended configuration). Additionally there are some optional arguments: ```--shpbasedir SHPBASEDIR``` will write out the nodes and reaches as shapefile format (written as netCDF to ```out_riverobs_file```), ```-l LOG_LEVEL``` controls the verbosity of the logging, and ```--gdem-file GDEM_FILE``` will create a pixc_file from the GDEM file and run RiverObs on that as a type of truth processing.

# Prior Reach Database
RiverObs requires a prior reach and node database. The database contains fixed node locations, reach boundaries, and high-resolution reach centerlines. It is distributed as a set of netcdf files, broken by continent (first two characters in the file name) and "major basins" in the continent (3rd and 4th characters in the file name). Metadata describing the database fields and the current version of the database is available here (Apr 15th 2019 -- netcdfV4.zip): https://osu.app.box.com/s/0rvisixd9lung1nqxkjo3msl89z9nkvk 

## Summary of packages provided

**RiverObs**: This is the main package for associating data with river
reaches, and estimating hydrology parameters base on reach
averaging (or not...). In addition to the homegrown packages listed
below, this package requires the following open source packages:

* [numpy](http://www.scipy.org/): Numerics swiss army knife.
* [netCDF4](code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python): Reading netcdf4 files,
  including SWOT L2 data files.
* [StatsModels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net): Fitting and
  estimation tools.
